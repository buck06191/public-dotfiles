Public Dotfiles Repo
## Installation

```
./install.sh
```

Any others will need to be kept in sync manually (e.g. if there are company specific requirements for the `.zshrc` file)

## Neovim

Use https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim to manage the setup.

To debug any problems run `:messages` and look at what the error is. It is probably the
case that some external package or language server isn't installed.
