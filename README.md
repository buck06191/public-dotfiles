## Installation

Need to install:

- tsserver
- stylua
- eslint_d
- prettier_d
- gopls
- hack nerd font mono (to see the correct icons. Any nerd font will do)
- 


To install plugins run `:PlugInstall` from inside neovim and then restart neovim.

To debug any problems run `:messages` and look at what the error is. It is probably the
case that some external package or language server isn't installed.
